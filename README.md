## DOGS-VS-CATS-PREDICTION

The project intends to create a classifier to predict if an image represents a Dog or a Cat.

The classification is as Dogs - 1 and Cats - 0 

The dataset of the CLASSIFICATION OF DOGS VS CATS has been retrieved from Kaggle, I have placed a link below to it

Languages and libraries used
* Python 3.6
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* LiveLossPlot

Used ImageDataGenerator to randomly rotate the images through any degree between 0 and 360 degree.

Implemented the Conv2D, Sequential, MaxPooling2D, Dense, Dropout, Flatten layers for the deep learning model.

The accuracy is measured to be 99% based on Precision and Recall
